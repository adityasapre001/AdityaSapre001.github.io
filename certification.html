            <li> <b> <font size="+2">Analysis of Enzyme Chemotaxis under Flow Free Static Gradients using Microfluidic Devices. (December 2020 to present) </font></b><br>
		    <b>Principal Investigator: Dr Ayusman Sen (Penn State University) </b><br>
                We are trying to study the fundamental properties of environmentally benign Lignin Nanoparticles, their size distributions using dynamic light scattering and surface charges using Zeta potential measurements. We are trying to analyse the Brotrytis fungal growth and interactions with lignin nanoparticles over potato dextrose agar plates with the help of various types of microscopy techniques (optical and confocal microscopy), SEM. We have chosen rose petals as the model biological surface to macroscopically observe the overall infectivity and the antifungal properties of EbNPs.</li>

                <b>Academic Collaborator: Dr Anna Balazs (University of Pittsburgh) </b><br>

                <b>Principal Investigator: Dr Orlin D Velev (NC State University) </b><br>

		<li> <b> <font size="+2">Observing the aggregation trends of Chymotrypsinogen and Immunoglobulin G using dynamic light scattering (May 2019 to March 2020) </font></b> <br>
               <b>Principal Investigator: Dr Orlin D Velev (NC State University) <br>
               Industrial collaborator: Dr James McAndrew ( Airgas - an Air Liquide Company) </b><br>
               Prevention of the denaturation or aggregation of a protein chain is a conundrum in front of the world research community. Thus, here we are trying to study the fundamentals behind protein aggregation based on their hydrophobic interactions and chain folding behaviors. Also the work involves examination of the effects of various solvents on protein aggregation using dynamic light scattering. </li>
            
		<li> <b> <font size="+2">Evaluation of Chitosan modified and unmodified Lignin Nanoparticle toxicity using embryonic zebrafish and other aquatic bodies species (May 2019 to December 2019)</font></b> <br> 
                <b> Principal Investigator: Dr Orlin D Velev (NC State University)<br>
                Academic collaborator: Dr Stacey Harper (Oregon State University) </b><br>
		My role in this project is to synthesize Lignin nanoparticles using flash precipitation method with and without chitosan additions. We follow simple pH adjustment techniques in order to integrate the nanoparticles. Further these particles are used by Dr Harper to understand their interactions with zebrafish and other aquatic colonies.</li>
			
		<li> <b> <font size="+2">Synthesis and analysis of perfume core-based polymer microcapsules modified with nanoparticles (June 2017 to May 2018)</font></b> <br>
                 <b> Principal Investigator: Dr K. Shanmuganathan (National Chemical Laboratory)<br>
                Industrial Sponsorer: Spray Tek Inc., PA. </b><br>
The goal of the project was to synthesize microcapsules with high cloth adherence and prolonged fragrance release properties. We designed Cloisite nanoclay based polyurea-urethane microcapsule shells which can easily adhere to cloth fibers. Moreover, the cloth washing trials with detergents from Spray-Tek went really successful to be able to provide a fragrance from the it for a week. These capsules are easy to synthesize and are more environmental friendly than the regular Urea-formaldehyde microcapsules.

            <li> <b> <font size="+2">Synthesis of insecticide based Polyurea-urethane microcapsules for household paints and pigment applications (December 2017 to May 2018)</font></b> <br> 
                <b> Principal Investigator: Dr K. Shanmuganathan (National Chemical Laboratory)<br>
                Industrial Collaborator: Pidilite Pvt Ltd, PA. </b><br>
We analyzed the sustainable and suitable trends of insecticide release from the polyurea-nanocomposite based microcapsules when mixed with household used paints. Also the work involves studying the alterations in the release trends by incorporation of nanoparticles like hydrophobic nanosilica or hydrophilic nanocellulose in the polymer capsule walls.</li>
            <li> <b> <font size="+2">Synthesis and characterization of mixed metal oxides used for catalysis of propane to propene conversion (December 2016 to June 2017)</font> </b> <br>
               <b>Principal Investigator: Dr T. Raja (National Chemical Laboratory)<br>
                Academic Collaborator: Dr Kavita Joshi (National Chemical Laboratory)</b><br>
We worked on synthesis of mixed transition metal oxides using pyrolysis, precipitation, salt-addition, etc. Further, we analysed the developed catalysts using XRD, FTIR for understanding the peculiarities in their structures. We had done some basic SEM and TEM studies to observe surface and core properties. Density Functional Theory (DFT) analysis was done to understand molecular interactions, enabling us to find an effective synthesis pathway.</li>
